# E-commerce website logs analysis | Data Engineering GCP project

## Introduction
I built an end-to-end pipeline for E-commerce website logs, focusing on fraud detection, user behavior, and segmentation analysis. The batch process runs on a weekly schedule, leveraging GCP (GCS, BigQuery), Spark, dbt, Docker, Looker, and Kestra to filter fraudulent traffic, segment users via RFM analysis, and assess membership impact. The results: improved data integrity by eliminating fraudulent traffic, enhanced user analytics through precise segmentation, and optimized engagement strategies that drive retention and revenue growth.

## Problem description
Fraudulent traffic, inaccurate analytics, and inefficient targeting of the website led to revenue loss and poor business decisions. This project ensures clean data, accurate insights, and optimized targeting for better business decisions.
