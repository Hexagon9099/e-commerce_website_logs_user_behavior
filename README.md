# E-commerce website logs analysis | Data Engineering GCP project

## Introduction
I built an end-to-end pipeline for E-commerce website logs, focusing on fraud detection, user behavior, and segmentation analysis. The batch process runs on a weekly schedule, leveraging GCP (GCS, BigQuery), Spark, dbt, Docker, Looker, and Kestra to filter fraudulent traffic, segment users via RFM analysis, and assess membership impact. The results: improved data integrity by eliminating fraudulent traffic, enhanced user analytics through precise segmentation, and optimized engagement strategies that drive retention and revenue growth.

## Problem description
The website faced challenges with fraudulent traffic and inefficient user segmentation, leading to poor analytics and revenue loss. This project implemented a robust fraud detection system and refined user segmentation, ensuring accurate insights and optimized targeting strategies.
